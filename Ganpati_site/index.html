            <h4>The First Step…</h4>
            <div style="height: 15rem;overflow-y:scroll;background-color: white;">
                <p class="flow-text">
                    When enthusiasm is at its peak, when the festive mood settles in, when communities come together,
                    and
                    when you hear people cheering and reciting “Ganpati Bappa Morya”, you know Lord Ganesha has arrived.
                    Ganpati is also known as Gajanana because he possesses anana (head) of gaj (commonly considered as
                    elephant). However, the vedic puranas refer gaj (symbolizing immortal wisdom) as the opposite of jag
                    (symbolizing world as a mortal entity). Gajanana, the lord of wisdom, not only shows us the path but
                    also paves the path for us, only if we are willing to walk the path.
                    Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak started the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi in order to bring the masses
                    together and more importantly to establish a perpetual stream of thought in the society by bridging
                    the
                    gap between the common thoughts and the uncommon intelligence. Tilak was a visionary, an astute man
                    who
                    wanted the society to progress.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    Tilak’s Ganeshotav assumed the nature of a gala public celebration. Though the nature of the
                    festival
                    was visible and comprehensible, its core remained partly unfathomable. Thus, even though the reasons
                    for
                    celebration changed, the need for awakening and spreading awareness still has not ceased. In the
                    evolution of new era, technology advanced, society progressed, but the changes were not reflected in
                    the
                    way the festival was celebrated. Traditions were well adopted but the changes were not adapted. As
                    years
                    passed, the festival was celebrated with greater devotion, however Mother Nature suffered a lot due
                    to
                    man’s unwanted intervention. It was crucial to accurately assess the situation and we are proud of
                    the
                    fact that we are trying to accomplish it.

                    Mahatma Gandhi once said, “be the change you wish to see in the world”; comprehending this adage, in
                    2010 K.D.G.B. Niwas, Girgaon adopted the new concept of establishing Mumbai’s first ever
                    eco-friendly
                    Ganesh Festival; thereby adapting the new practices. A durable idol made of fiber was set up in the
                    society premises. A temple-like structure was created for the idol in the society. George Bernard
                    Shaw
                    said, “Progress is impossible without change and those who cannot change their minds cannot change
                    anything.” It takes time to accept change. However, our generation believes that if the change is
                    for
                    the benefit of all, then it does get accepted sooner or later. Since our intention was good, we did
                    not
                    worry about the consequences. That year, everyone was curious, because the idol was not going to
                    arrive
                    from outside as always, but rather the procession was going to start from the society premises
                    itself
                    and the idol was going to be welcomed and placed in the decorated pandal built in the society. Like
                    every year, Bappa arrived in a procession accompanied with the divine music from the drumbeats. Many
                    changes have taken place ever since, have even been accepted, but what has remained unchanged to
                    date is
                    the sheer serenity and contentment that one gets to experience in those 11 days. As always, those 11
                    days were divine, filled with fun, excitement, and peace. There was bewilderment as the time
                    approached
                    to bid adieu to our beloved Bappa. There was an uneasy feeling of longing, but the idol was anyway
                    coming back to the society premises! That was a moment of enlightenment. That was when we realized
                    that
                    the idol was just an image, a source; while the basis of celebration is in our minds and its
                    acknowledgement are the teary eyes and heavy heart at the time of the Maha-aarti (divine song) while
                    bidding goodbye to the remover of obstacles, Lord Ganesha... This was the very moment of true
                    awakening.
                    Ganesha’s immersion procession was just a visit to Girgaon Chowpatty and back. The immersion
                    ceremony
                    was as grand as the welcome, with lazim, drum-beats, trumpets, devotional songs and dancing.
                    Usually,
                    the immersion ritual is accomplished by releasing the idol into the sea. However, that year we
                    carried
                    out all the pre-immersion rituals and returned with the idol. On the way back we faced an array of
                    rhetoric questions, expressions and of course, different exclamations from the people who were
                    taking
                    their idols for immersion. But without ignoring them or reacting to any of those with sarcasm, we
                    tried
                    to answer all respectfully. We explained to them the concept of our eco-friendly way of celebration
                    since we wanted to spread awareness in the society and not simply keep it restricted to our own
                    community. As quoted by Wendell Berry, “The Earth is what we all have in common.”

                <p class="flow-text">
                    In this framework the association formed by the youth of K.D.G.B. Niwas took up the task of
                    decorating
                    the Ganesh pandal that reflected the current situations in the world. Themes like “Save Water”,
                    “Save
                    Trees”, ‘Female foeticide’, ‘Crimes against Women’, ‘Global Warming’, ‘Right to Education’ and such
                    other social issues were brought to the fore. Thanks to the students of J.J. School of Arts, Mumbai,
                    Chetana College and other such institutions who with the stroke of their brush wonderfully portrayed
                    these issues on the walls of the pandal. Similarly, the association is also carrying out several
                    workshops, blood donation drives, free eye check-up and medical camps with the help of the amount
                    collected from the donations. The nature of eco-friendly celebration is evolving over the years. The
                    association has also been organizing various resourceful programs for the welfare of the society and
                    the
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    The association is conducting several competitions and programs for the residents of K.D.G.B. Niwas.
                    The
                    most popular of these is the ‘Treasure Hunt’ competition. It is laudable how the older generation
                    runs
                    for clues on the streets of Girgaon. Another most-awaited competition is the ‘Annakot’ or cooking
                    competition. Everyone, kids and adults alike, waits for the competition to end just to relish/feast
                    upon
                    the delectable dishes presented by the female as well as the male chefs of Niwas. Apart from
                    spreading
                    awareness in the society, we also consider it to be our duty to educate and discipline the new
                    generations. Therefore, memory games, drawing-painting competitions, outdoor games, indoor games, as
                    well as dancing, singing competitions, musical chairs among others are organized for all age groups.
                    What is praiseworthy is the high energy that is experienced for drama as the kids start writing the
                    story and rehearsing their dialogues in the summer vacation, which is almost 3-4 months before the
                    Ganesh Festival.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    Besides these activities, the holy fabric (uparane and sovale) on the idol is changed every day in
                    those
                    11 days. Ganeshyaag, a ritual of Ganesh Puja is organized on a Sunday so that most of the residents
                    can
                    be available for the same. Likewise, Mahaprasad, feast is also arranged for all. An important point
                    to
                    be noted is that the food is served in bio-degradable banana-leaf dishes and bowls. This is the best
                    time as the current as well as the residents who resided in Niwas previously meet each other after a
                    year and exchange greetings! The residents not only relish the feast but also actively volunteer in
                    arranging the tables and serving the food.
                    “The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.” – Robert Swan. We
                    know
                    that charity begins at home. For that, we have taken the first step and expect that others will
                    follow
                    our lead in saving Mother Nature and thereby fulfilling the true objective behind Sarvajanik
